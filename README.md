# 🛠️ Dare Exchange — A Django Practice Project

**Dare Exchange** is a simple web app built during my journey of learning **Django**. It implements core **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Django's powerful framework features like models, views, forms, and templates.

This is a **practice project**, and while it's not a full-fledged app yet, it helped me understand the basics of backend development, database integration, and Django’s project structure.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- 🔧 Setting up Django projects and apps
- 📄 Creating and managing models, forms, views, and templates
- 📝 Implementing full CRUD functionality
- 🎯 Understanding Django's admin panel and routing system
- 💡 How Django handles data using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

---

## 🔍 Features

- ✨ Add new dares (Create)
- 👀 View all posted dares (Read)
- 🖊️ Edit existing dares (Update)
- 🗑️ Delete a dare (Delete)

All operations are handled using Django forms and views in a clean, functional way.
